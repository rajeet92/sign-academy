            I had done the foundation courses in <b>SIGN ACADEMY</b> from 9th std. It was solely because of Sir’s teaching that I was able to perform well in many of the competitive exams including Olympiads. In my 10th std. attending the foundation classes helped me to fair well in SSC board exams with 95% with the help of their coaching I was able to crack the admission exam in a reputed CBSE based school for my 11th std.

           Hey friends, very happy to share that this has ended on a very glorified note! Our daughter Sanika scored 98.78 percentile in Mh-CET 2019! Well, do you think this is a good score to be so happy about when there are much more talented people proving their excellence in more tougher exams like JEE and NEET? Ofcourse we are aware of it but we are celebrating. We are celebrating the sincere efforts put in, the hectic schedules of long working hours (almost 14/day), the tremendous amount of mental, physical and emotional stress experienced in these two years. We are celebrating her guts to fight back those emotional bouts of frustration which pulled her down, the courage to keep her goal always on a high! But she was not alone on this journey- she had a strong team of her parents and younger sister Tanisha (mandatory mention!) supporting her! Am I missing out mentioning somebody very important? Yes, it's these two people without whom it would never be possible to see Sanika come out with flying colours- Ajeet sir and Lokesh sir of SIGN institute! Thank you is a very small word to express the huge gratitude towards these real GURUS! Besides their incomparable teaching skills, they're the ones who go out of the way to help their 'Shishyas'- may it be motivation or a doubt asked on WhatsApp in the middle of the night!! I have witnessed this almost every night at 1 or even 2:45 am! We joined SIGN really too late. But sir worked with utmost dedication and completed the portion of 2 years within a year! They neither took a single holiday nor did they visit their home for almost a year! Just a month before the entrance exam, a crash course was conducted on our request, without charging any fees (when people were spending 40,000/- on such courses!) They had just returned from home (Bihar and Allahabad) where the temperature was 8°-10° and Solapur was hitting more than 40°! There were merely 1or 2 students attending, but there they stood teaching, 4-5 hours, not caring at all for the temperature, number of students or the fees! This is what we call DEDICATION!
We will always be thankful to you sir.

They are not only excellent in their teaching skills but also guide us through problems and obstacles.

           I felt blessed after I joined the <b>SIGN ACADEMY</b> because the teaching I experienced  here is very good . Teachers here motivate and guide us very well for our future. Regular classes go in in which we also feel inspired towards our career. Regularly weekly test which have probably increased our grades and notes of every topic are provided to us which are very understandable. Finally I have experienced a lot of progress in my learning here
